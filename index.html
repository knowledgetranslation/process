			<h2 id="companion-documents"><a href="#companion-documents">0. Companion documents</a></h2>
<p>These companion documents provide more in-depth information than is available here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>How to conduct usability testing</em> (forthcoming)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Working with git and GitHub</em> (forthcoming)</p></li>
<li><p><em>When to use third-party web applications</em> (forthcoming)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Collaboration between designers and developers</em> (forthcoming)</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We recommend that you read this document in its entirety before beginning a project, and refer to it often throught the project lifecycle. Although different sections of this document may apply to one type of reader more than the other (e.g. the <a href="#design-steps">Design Steps</a> are primarily targeted to designers), all readers can learn from all sections, and will benefit from having a holistic understanding of the process.</p>
<p>This process builds in lots of padding to budget, timelines, and scope. This creates failsafes to help mitigate the consequences of the unexpected barriers that lead projects to run over-budget, over-time, and under-scope.</p>
<h2 id="principles"><a href="#principles">2. Principles</a></h2>
<p>These principles should be examined and considered before the project starts, when the project ends, and at every step in between. At every step, every team member should consider how the principles apply to the step as a whole, and to their work in that step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Every website needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, every website needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility">accessible</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, every website needs to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Every stakeholder is a team member and every team member is a stakeholder.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exception: To avoid bias, usability tests should ideally be conducted and summarized by people completely separate from the rest of the team.</p>
<p>If the team members are the ones conducting usability tests, every effort should be made to avoid bias in testing.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><em>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)</em> states that a stakeholder is someone who “is actively involved in the project; has interests that may be positively or negatively affected by the performance or completion of the project; [or] may exert influence over the project, its deliverables or its team members”.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The <a href="http://www.pmi.org/">Project Management Institute</a>’s <a href="http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/">Voices on Project Management blog</a> suggests that different stakes to consider: interest, rights, ownership, knowledge, impact or influence, and contribution.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Involve all stakeholders at every step of the project, every meeting, and every decision point. Everybody should have the <em>opportunity</em> to participate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Involvement should be discussed and agreed upon at the first meeting. The team should make decisions about what the expectations are for every team member and what the timelines for response are.</p></li>
<li><p>For some parts of the project, a team member’s involvement will be mandatory, for others optional; but, every team member should have the option to participate in every stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Involvement does not simply equal presence. Every team member should have the option of <em>participating actively</em> and should be encouraged to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>E.g. designers should be involved during content creation, developers should be involved while creating timelines, users should be involved while planning scope<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Trust the expertise of your experts <em>in their area of expertise</em>. Being an expert in one area doesn’t make somebody an expert in another area.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. a content expert is not a designer; a developer is not a scientist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Don’t give disproportionate or inappropriate weight to trivial issues.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>e.g holding a meeting to discuss a typeface or the colour of a design element is probably not the best use of the team’s time. Instead, focus on content, functionality, and usability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Remember the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</a>, a founding web design principle encoded by the World Wide Web Consortium and Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (the organizations responsible for web standards):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity. In other words costs or difficulties to the user should be given more weight than costs to authors; which in turn should be given more weight than costs to implementors; which should be given more weight than costs to authors of the spec itself, which should be given more weight than those proposing changes for theoretical reasons alone. Of course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The original principle defines “authors” as web authors (i.e. web developers and designers who are building a site), “implementors” as browser implementors (i.e. software developers who build web browsers), and “specifiers” as those writing web standards specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>For our projects, we can alter these definitions while still retaining the spirit of the principle. “Specifiers” would be those team members who are responsible for planning, and “implementors” would be those responsible for content; the definitions for “users”, “authors”, and “theoretical purity” can remain unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>With these new definitions, we can resolve conflicts by giving more weight to costs/difficulties affecting users over developers/designers over content creators over planners over theoretical purity. But, as always, solutions should ideally improve things for multiple/all constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that this principle does not mean we should always defer to what each constituency wants or says they want; it means that in cases of conflict we should look at evidence and use that evidence to prioritize benefits to users over authors, etc.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> We always prioritize evidence over expert opinion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No single user is more important than another user.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. mobile users need the same access to the same content as desktop users, disabled users need the same access to the same content as able users, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usability tests are for identifying problems, not for generating suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users might think they know how to solve these problems, but they may be wrong. They aren’t the experts in tool development, you are. <em>However</em>, they may be knowledge experts in the context of the tool usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Usability test summaries focus on identifying problems rather than solutions. While user-suggested solutions should be considered, final decisions on solutions should be decided by experts on your team.</p></li>
<li><p>“Users are most valuable in helping designers know what a system should do, but not in helping designers determine how best to have the system do it.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usability testing should only ever focus on one area at a time (e.g. either content, look-and-feel, or functionality). If you want to test multiple areas, conduct separate usability tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usability tests should have specific performance and success goals.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You’re building for the web, so use web-compatible technologies.</p>
<p>When you use a technology that’s not directly compatible with the web, the content you generate needs to be <em>adapted</em> or <em>translated</em> before it can be used. In some cases this can lead to loss of quality (e.g. with images being recompressed as they are converted), the introduction of errors (e.g. with text being transferred between programs or re-typed). In all cases it will introduce a financial and time cost, by creating more work for developers and designers who need to adapt this content.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create content using plain text, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, or HTML; not in Microsoft Word (and especially not PDFs or PowerPoint).</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, design <em>in the browser</em><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> using CSS, not in software designed for print, like Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign (and especially not in non-design software like PowerPoint, Word, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Define design in terms of web units (e.g. colours as hex values, sizes and distances in pixels and ems, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate using version control software and services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, not by emailing and turning on Track Changes in Microsoft Word.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make sure all designs account for and define all interactions and states (clicks, hovers, transitions, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>A site should be completely usable without any special instruction to the user, and without any documentation.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>“A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.” —Martin LeBlanc<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>“No line of instruction will compensate for a bad design.” —Robert Hoekman Jr.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Build everything (content, design, development) modularly: you’ll probably be on another project where you can re-use components.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., Brad Frost’s <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design methodology</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If possible, provide translations, localization, and/or internationalization that is appropriate for your intended audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you’re building a site in English only <em>now</em>, build it so that translation, localization, and/or internationalization can be easily incorporated later.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if explicit translation doesn’t occur, sites should still be built so that they’re easy for users to translate on their own, using machine translation (e.g. <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>), and easy to understand if English is not their first language. (Note that these are accessibility requirements under <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#meaning">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Guideline 3.1</a>.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Avoid social components (e.g. forums, chat, blogs, social media) when possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social media sharing “widgets” have huge performance costs (i.e. they slow down your site)<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and there is little evidence to suggest that they increase sharing or traffic.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> They can also be used to track your users, creating potential security and privacy issues.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Forums, blogs, and chat often suffer because they don’t offer anything that users can’t get elsewhere. To be successful, these components “must have a specific purpose and deliver value members aren’t receiving elsewhere”.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In order to maintain reader intesest, these must also be updated frequently with high-quality content, which creates time and financial burdens and is difficult to maintain.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Even when properly maintained, users may not use or benefit from these features.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Avoid requiring users to log in with a username and password.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a password cannot be avoided, show it in plain text with an option to obscure it<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and provide an automated way for users to reset their own passwords.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keep sites up-to-date and relevant, and plan <em>how</em> you’ll do this on an ongoing basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Document everything you do at every step and use version control software for every piece.</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody should track their hours. Ideally hours should be tracked according to specific tasks. One good way to do this is to make every task a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> issue, and associate all hours with specific issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking the time it takes to create each feature can help with scoping and budgeting future projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Publish what you publish. Knowledge translation depends on dissemination; we need share what we’re creating.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make all website content public, not password protected or behind a paywall.</p></li>
<li><p>If it can’t be made public, then it probably shouldn’t be on the website. Use other services, like intranets, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Open source all the developed designs, code, documentation, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out what your rights are when you publish papers about the project. If possible make the papers available as widely as possible, for free, even if it costs extra money.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Research as much as possible. Learn as much as possible. Collect as much relevant data as possible. We should always strive to do evidence-based web development.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in the open. Avoid decision-making over email or in private conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All meetings should have a secretary, and that secretary should take notes <em>visibly</em> (e.g. on a whiteboard, so other attendees can contribute and update notes where they see fit). Ideally, meetings should also be audio recorded and made available to members who weren’t able to attend. Ideally, any sketches should be photographed/scanned and be included with the minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>All decision-making between meetings should be done in an open forum, such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Give credit where it’s due. In <a href="#steps">Steps 1–3</a> you’ll clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member. With all the documentation you develop, including git logs and timesheets, you’ll be able to verify who did what. Give appropriate credit to <em>everyone</em> in <em>all</em> the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the website (e.g. in a humans.txt file, in page metadata)</li>
<li>in the website’s documentation (e.g. CONTRIBUTORS.MD on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li>in papers about the project (e.g. authorship for anybody that had decision-making responsibility, acknowledgements for every other team member)</li>
<li>in presentations (e.g. on an acknowledgements slide)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="steps"><a href="#steps">3. Steps</a></h2>
<p>When possible, all steps should be completed in sequence, not in parallel.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Determine who the stakeholders and team members are.</p></li>
<li><p>For each of the following areas, determine which team member is the most responsible person: planning, content, design, development, and science. The most responsible person should be an expert in their area.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most responsible person will have the final decision on matters related to their area(s).</p></li>
<li><p>All other team members are still welcome to provide <em>feedback</em> on all other areas.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For every team member that’s not a most responsible person, determine which area (planning, content, design, development, and science) they will focus on.</p>
<ul>
<li>All other team members are still welcome to provide <em>feedback</em> on all other areas, but they should have a specific focus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Determine the maximum budget that is available, and divide by two. This is your operating budget.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember: extra money is a good problem to have.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using your operating budget and timelines as guides, determine the ideal project scope<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, then reduce it by half. This is your scope for <em>this phase</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A focused project is more likely to be successful, and there will always be time for more phases later.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be best to think of each phase as a collection of specific features. (E.g. Phase 1 might be a collection of static content pages, Phase 2 might add videos or other interactive content, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to consider <em>all</em> the steps in this document when considering timelines, including multiple rounds of usability and testing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plan exactly what data you’d like collected for research, testing, and development/planning purposes, and define why you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collecting “too much” data, to the point where you’re overwhelmed by it, is a risk. However, not having data that you later realize you need is also a risk. If you think you <em>might</em> need it, it’s probably worth collecting.</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, try to collect as much data as possible <em>anonymously</em>. Identifiable data should be avoided whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re collecting data, write a privacy policy and submit it to the Research Ethics Board (REB) and/or Legal department, and make sure to include it in the publicly-available content you develop in the <a href="#content-steps">Content steps</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Research</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Study the data collected from other projects and earlier versions of this project, and interview stakeholders (especially users). Determine what content and features are important to whom and why, how they will be used, and where they will be accessed from.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Every team member should spend at least one full day reading about their area of focus (and especially about how it applies to the web), and another full day about an area on which they aren’t focusing and/or in which they aren’t an expert. This helps ensure that everybody’s knowledge is current and continues to grow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Based on your research, create user personas that reflect different types of typical and atypical users.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>usability.gov provides <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">a detailed method for creating user personas</a>, including best practices, questions to ask, elements to consider, examples, and references.</p></li>
<li><p>When creating user personas for accessibility testing, remember to consider a wide range of accessibility concerns. See, for example, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-July-31">An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that these form a useful but incomplete subset of your users; real users will never behave as you expect, nor should they.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#content-steps">Content steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#design-steps">Design steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#development-steps">Development steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a launch plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If this is an update to an existing site, develop a plan for how users will transition to the new version. Give them options to opt-in to the new version early and to opt-out for a set period after launch. Plan specific changeover dates and stick to them. Create and make available change documentation explaining what has changed and why.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Provide communication and feedback channels, and plan how these will be monitored.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan how data will be monitored during the launch/transition period, and how to react/make adjustments based on this data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a post-launch plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decide what actions will be required for maintaining and updating the site, who will be responsible for this, and where the funds will come from.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for how to monitor and react to usage and other data post-launch. For example, tracking usage of individual features can help determine if they should be removed, and can help with scoping and budgeting for future projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for who will monitor and respond to the communication channels that were defined in your launch plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Once the final phase of your launch plan is complete, implement your post-launch plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are in the post-launch phase, have all the stakeholders go over the built-up documentation (minutes, git logs, documentation, style guides, READMEs, help files, timesheets, papers written, etc.) and compile a “bible” for the project.</p>

<h3 id="content-steps"><a href="#content-steps">3.1 Content steps</a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Develop or choose an existing style guide for content, <em>before</em> you actually start creating any of the content. This style guide should be updated throughout the process (as indicated).<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Making already-created content conform to your style guide is much more work than developing content with a style guide already in-place.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of well-known existing style guides for content include <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/">The Chicago Manual of Style</a> and <a href="http://www.thecanadianpress.com/products_and_services.aspx?id=86">The Canadian Press Stylebook</a> (which St. Michael’s uses as the base for its internal style guide). These include information about how spelling, punctuation, capitalization, grammar, and formatting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Information Architecture (IA): create a plan for how your content will be structured, both at a high-level (e.g. site navigation) and a low-level (e.g. sections within documents/pages). Then, reduce the complexity of your IA by half.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<li><p>Create your content, in compliance with your style guide and IA, keeping in mind your user personas. Then, delete half the content.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Your users usually have very specific goals when visiting a web site. Don’t clutter their experience, and don’t give them what they don’t need.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conduct usability testing on the content. Can users understand it and get the info they need?<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to test with <em>real</em> users and/or users that closely match each of your personas.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Revise the content based on the usability test feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the project’s style guide with any content and IA details that weren’t previously accounted for.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="design-steps"><a href="#design-steps">3.2 Design steps</a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create basic design templates that account for all the content and work well for all users, regardless of:</p>

<li><p>Device (e.g. phone, tablet, desktop, laptop, etc.)<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Browser (e.g. modern IE, obsolete IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Connection speed (e.g. high-speed/broadband, LTE, 3G, 2G, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability (e.g. using a mouse, using a keyboard, without assistive technology, with a screenreader, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>Language (e.g. with machine-translation support)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, this fallback should work in the “Default Delivery Context”, which <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">The W3C Recommendation on Mobile Web Best Practices</a> defines as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Usable Screen Width: 120 pixels, minimum</p></li>
<li><p>Markup Language Support: XHTML Basic 1.1 delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml</p></li>
<li><p>Character Encoding: UTF-8</p></li>
<li><p>Image Format Support: JPEG, GIF89a</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum Total Page Weight: 20 kilobytes</p></li>
<li><p>Colors: 256 Colors, minimum</p></li>
<li><p>Style Sheet Support: CSS Level 1. In addition, CSS Level 2 <span class="citation">@media</span> rule together with the handheld and all media types.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP: HTTP/1.0 or more recent [HTTP1.1]</p></li>
<li><p>Script: No support for client side scripting</p></li>

<li><p>Perform the <a href="#design-validation-substeps">Design validation substeps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Document in detail how each element of each template progressively enhances from the fallback design to the mobile design to the desktop design. Make sure there is complete content- and functionality-parity between all three designs, and that it’s clear how each element adjusts in changing circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>This process will probably require creating a few extra alternate design templates at different “breakpoints”, i.e. an adjustment when something breaks or looks bad at a certain size or when a certain feature is/isn’t supported. Always create these alternate templates based on breakpoints and not specific devices.</li>

<p>“Web feeds allow software programs to check for updates published on a website. To provide a web feed, the site owner may use specialized software (such as a content management system) that publishes a list (or ‘feed’) of recent articles or content in a standardized, machine-readable format. The feed can then be downloaded by programs that use it, like websites that syndicate content from the feed, or by feed reader programs that allow Internet users to subscribe to feeds and view their content.</p>
<p>“A feed contains entries, which may be headlines, full-text articles, excerpts, summaries, and/or links to content on a website, along with various metadata.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>back-end development</dt>
<dd><p>“In computer science, the front end is responsible for collecting input in various forms from the user and processing it to conform to a specification the back end can use. The front end is an interface between the user and the back end. The front and back ends may be distributed amongst one or more systems.</p>
<p>“In software architecture there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. Each can be spoken of as having a front end and a back end. The front is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>“In software design, for example, the model-view-controller architecture, provides front and back ends for the database, the user, and the data processing components. The separation of software systems into front and back ends simplifies development and separates maintenance. A rule of thumb is that the front (or ‘client’) side is any component manipulated by the user. The server-side (or ‘back end’) code resides on the server. The confusion arises when one must make front-end edits to server-side files. Most HTML designers, for instance, don’t need to be on the server when they are developing the HTML; conversely, the server-side engineers are, by definition, never on anything but a server. It takes both to ultimately make a functioning, interactive website.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>Bikeshedding</dt>
<dd><p>“Parkinson’s law of triviality, also known as bikeshedding, bike-shed effect, or the bicycle-shed example, is C. Northcote Parkinson’s 1957 argument that organizations give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. Parkinson observed and illustrated that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant spended the majority of its time with pointless discussions on relatively trivial and unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike-shed, while neglecting the less-trivial proposed design of the nuclear power plant itself, which is far more important but also far more difficult and complex task to criticize constructively.</p>
<p>“The law has been applied to software development and other activities, and the term ‘bikeshedding’ was coined as a metaphor to illuminate Parkinson’s Law of Triviality and was popularized in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by Poul Henning-Kamp and has spread from there to the software industry at large.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshedding">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>client-side</dt>
<dd><p>“Client-side refers to operations that are performed by the client in a client–server relationship in a computer network.</p>
<p>“Typically, a client is a computer application, such as a web browser, that runs on a user’s local computer or workstation and connects to a server as necessary. Operations may be performed client-side because they require access to information or functionality that is available on the client but not on the server, because the user needs to observe them or provide input, or because the server lacks the processing power to perform the operations in a timely manner for all of the clients it serves. Additionally, if operations can be performed by the client, without sending data over the network, they may take less time, use less bandwidth, and incur a lesser security risk.</p>
<p>“When the server serves data in a commonly used manner, for example according to the HTTP or FTP protocols, users may have their choice of a number of client programs (most modern web browsers can request and receive data using both of those protocols). In the case of more specialized applications, programmers may write their own server, client, and communications protocol, that can only be used with one another.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_side">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>code review</dt>
<dd><p>“Code review is systematic examination (often known as peer review) of computer source code.

</dd>
<dt>CSS</dt>
<dd><p>“Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.</p>
<p>“CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content (such as by allowing for tableless web design). It obviates those portions of markup that would specify presentation by instead providing that information in a separate file. For each relevant HTML element (identified by tags), it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, it might say (in CSS syntax), ‘All heading 1 elements should be bold.’ Therefore, no formatting markup such as bold tags (<code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code>)is needed within the content; what is needed is simply semantic markup saying, ‘this text is a level 1 heading.’” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>DNS</dt>
<dd><p>“The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating computer services and devices worldwide. The Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.</p>
<p>“An often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, the DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service’s location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dns">Wikipedia</a></p>

A grid can be used to organize graphic elements in relation to a page, in relation to other graphic elements on the page, or relation to other parts of the same graphic element or shape.…</p>
<p>“While grid systems have seen significant use in print media, interest from web developers has only recently seen a resurgence. Website design frameworks producing HTML and CSS had existed for a while before newer frameworks popularised the use of grid-based layouts. Some grid systems specify fixed-width elements with pixels, and some are ‘fluid’, meaning that they call for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(graphic_design)">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>hex values</dt>
<dd><p>“A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications, to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the Truecolor (24-bit RGB) color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Byte 1: red value (color type red)</li>
<li>Byte 2: green value (color type green)</li>
<li>Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)</li>
</ul>
<p>“For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a greyish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the 6 hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.</p>
<p>“Note that if any one of the three color values is less than 16 (decimal) or 10 (hex), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.</p>
<p>“The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 2563 or 224 = 16,777,216.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_value#Hex_triplet">Wikipedia</a></p>

HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
<p>“A web browser can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a programming language.</p>
<p>“HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

<p>“Lint as a term can also refer more broadly to syntactic discrepancies in general, especially in interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python. For example, modern lint checkers are often used to find code that doesn’t correspond to certain style guidelines. They can also be used as simple debuggers for common errors, or hard to find errors such as heisenbugs.</p>
<p>“This technique is formally referred to as static code analysis.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>Markdown</dt>
<dd><p>“Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name.

<dt>markup language</dt>
<dd><p>“A (document) markup language is a modern system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the ‘marking up’ of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors’ manuscripts. In digital media this ‘blue pencil instruction text’ was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or ‘instruction text encapsulated by tags’.</p>
<p>“Examples are typesetting instructions such as those found in troff, TeX and LaTeX, or structural markers such as XML tags. Markup instructs the software displaying the text to carry out appropriate actions, but is omitted from the version of the text that is displayed to users. Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics, meaning that their specification prescribes how the structured data are to be presented; others, such as XML, do not.</p>
<p>“HyperText Markup Language (HTML), one of the document formats of the World Wide Web, is an instance of SGML (though, strictly, it does not comply with all the rules of SGML), and follows many of the markup conventions used in the publishing industry in the communication of printed work between authors, editors, and printers.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Wikipedia</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>metadata</dt>
<dd><p>“Meta elements are tags used in HTML or XHTML documents to provide structured metadata about a Web page. They are part of a web page’s head section. Multiple Meta elements with different attributes can be used on the same page. Meta elements can be used to specify page description, keywords and any other metadata not provided through the other head elements and attributes.</p>
<p>“The meta element has two uses: either to emulate the use of an HTTP response header, or to embed additional metadata within the HTML document.</p>
<p>“With HTML up to and including HTML 4.01 and XHTML, there were four valid attributes: content, http-equiv, name and scheme. Under HTML 5 there are now five valid attributes, charset having been added. http-equiv is used to emulate an HTTP header, and name to embed metadata. The value of the statement, in either case, is contained in the content attribute, which is the only required attribute unless charset is given. charset is used to indicate the character set of the document, and is available in HTML5.</p>
<p>“Such elements must be placed as tags in the head section of an HTML or XHTML document.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>paywall</dt>
<dd><p>“A paywall is a system that prevents Internet users from accessing webpage content without a paid subscription. There are both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ paywalls in use. ‘Hard’ paywalls allow minimal to no access to content without subscription, while ‘soft’ paywalls allow more flexibility in what users can view without subscribing, such as selective free content and/or a limited number of articles per month, or the sampling of several pages of a book or paragraphs of an article. Newspapers have been implementing paywalls on their websites to increase their revenue, which has been diminishing due to a decline in print subscriptions and advertising revenue.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>“PHP code can be simply mixed with HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter, which is usually implemented as a web server’s native module or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. After the PHP code is interpreted and executed, the web server sends resulting output to its client, usually in form of a part of the generated web page – for example, PHP code can generate a web page’s HTML code, an image, or some other data. PHP has also evolved to include a command-line interface (CLI) capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">Wikipedia</a></p>

Such a file is usually a text file called README.TXT, README.md, README.1ST, READ.ME, or simply README, although some Microsoft Windows software may occasionally include a README.WRI, README.RTF, or README.DOC. The name is chosen so that users unaware of the existence of this type of file would be drawn to read it. It is traditionally written in upper case so that on case-preserving environments using an ASCIIbetical ordering, the name will appear near the beginning of a directory listing (since upper-case letters sort before lower-case letters in ASCIIbetical ordering).” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readme">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>“A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries, an extension of the <span class="citation">@media</span> rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.</li>
<li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.</li>
<li>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.”</li>

Such information, when related to reviews, people profiles, business listings, and events will be used by Google to enhance the ‘snippet’, or short piece of quoted text that is shown when the page appears in search listings. Google specifies that that data may be given using microdata, microformats or RDFa. Microdata is specified inside <code>itemtype</code> and <code>itemprop</code> attributes added to existing HTML elements; microformat keywords are added inside class attributes as discussed above; and RDFa relies on <code>rel</code>, <code>typeof</code> and <code>property</code> attributes added to existing elements.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">Wikipedia</a></p>

An RSS document (called ‘feed’, ‘web feed’, or ‘channel’) includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author’s name.</p>
<p>“RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically. A standard XML file format ensures compatibility with many different machines/programs. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favourite websites or to aggregate data from many sites.</p>
<p>“Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the web site for new content. Instead, their browser constantly monitors the site and informs the user of any updates.

Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems (OS), and embedded systems. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, this is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(computing)">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>search engine optimization</dt>
<dd><p>“Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s ‘natural’ or un-paid (‘organic’) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.</p>
<p>“As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Wikipedia</a></p>

<dt>security certificate</dt>
<dd><p>“In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document used to prove ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information about its owner’s identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate’s contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.</p>
<p>“In a typical public-key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signer is a certificate authority (CA), usually a company such as VeriSign which charges customers to issue certificates for them. In a web of trust scheme, the signer is either the key’s owner (a self-signed certificate) or other users (‘endorsements’) who the person examining the certificate might know and trust.</p>
<p>Certificates are an important component of Transport Layer Security (TLS, sometimes called by its older name SSL), where they prevent an attacker from impersonating a secure website or other server. They are also used in other important applications, such as email encryption and code signing.” —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">Wikipedia</a></p>

Semantic HTML is processed by regular web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users.</p>
<p>“As an example, recent HTML standards discourage use of the tag <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic, a typeface) in preference of more accurate tags such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (emphasis); the CSS stylesheet should then specify whether emphasis is denoted by an italic font, a bold font, underlining, slower or louder audible speech etc. This is because italics are used for purposes other than emphasis, such as citing a source…” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>“There are two popular versions of a site map. An XML Sitemap is a structured format that a user doesn’t need to see, but it tells the search engine about the pages in a site, their relative importance to each other, and how often they are updated.

This includes defining what fields of data will be stored and how that data will be stored: data type (numeric, currency, alphabetic, name, date, address) and any restrictions on the data input (number of characters…).</p>

Many applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data. On-page markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web.

<dt>version control software</dt>
<dd><p>“Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the ‘revision number’, ‘revision level’, or simply ‘revision’. For example, an initial set of files is ‘revision 1’. When the first change is made, the resulting set is ‘revision 2’, and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.</p>
<p>“The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.</p>
<p>“Version control systems (VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, e.g., Google Docs and Sheets and in various content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia’s Page history. Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other’s edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming.</p>

<p>“The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Given the variability in how users access the web, responsive design has become an industry standard; sites need to be responsive because we cannot account for how a user will be using a site. Not designing responsively risks excluding a large number of users. According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a>, in June 2014 mobile web usage is 26.64% (up from 15.31% in June 2013), tablet web usage is 6.4% (up from 4.65% in June 2013). Moreover, according to <a href="http://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/graph/?country=ca&amp;category=MOBI&amp;topic=Q09B&amp;stat=Q09B_1&amp;wave=2013&amp;age=all&amp;gender=all&amp;chart_type=&amp;active=stat">OurMobilePlanet</a>, 74% of Canadians access the web from their mobile devices daily. However, these discrete, broad categories can also obfuscate the fact that “mobile” and “tablet” aren’t really consistent; screen resolution varies wildly. <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> also tracks 14 separate screen resolutions that people use to access the web in signficant numbers, but the highest percentage of access for any one resolution is 20.13% (for 1366x768 pixels); far more users (27.84%) fall into the “other” category. We cannot design for individual devices, device types, or resolutions; we must instead allow our designs to <em>respond</em> to the users’ viewing context.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>“…One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts… Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations.” –Rabin Jo, McCathie Nevile Charles (eds.), 2008. <em>Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines</em>.

Involving users has the most value when trying to improve the completeness and accuracy of user requirements. It is also useful in helping to avoid unused or little-used system features.

<li id="fn8"><p>Using a usability tester without a vested interest in the project avoids injecting bias. From Rubin &amp; Chisnell, <em>Handbook of Usability Testing: How to Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests</em>, 2008, ‘Chapter 9. Conduct the Test Sessions’: “Take the attitude that you have no vested interest in the results one way or the other. Present the product neutrally (this does not mean you need to be solemn), so that the participants cannot ascertain any preference on your part. Never indicate through your speech or mannerisms that you strongly approve or disapprove of any actions or comments offered by a particular participant. React to ‘mistakes’ or ‘wrong turns’ in exactly the same way as you do to correct behavior. Never make participants feel stupid or inadequate (even inadvertently) by how you respond to their actions. If a participant is having problems, remember that it is the fault of the product. Period. Even if you say and do all the right things, participants will still blame themselves. If that happens, remind them of the value of their difficulties in understanding how the product actually works. Encourage them to freely explore areas without concern for ‘looking good.’”<a href="#fnref8">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn79"><p>“Ensure that Images Do Not Slow Downloads: Take steps to ensure that images do not negatively impact download speeds. Delays are frustrating to users. Strive to maintain download speeds to less than five seconds. To improve download speeds, use several small images rather than a single large image. Repeat images when possible, and save images with the ‘interlaced’ or ‘progressive’ option. Limit page sizes to less than 30,000 bytes. Minimize the number of different colors used in an image, and add pixel dimension tags (e.g., height and width) to the image reference. High Speed users may not notice anything different; however, these techniques will greatly improve download speeds for modem or hotspot users.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 14: Graphics, Images, and Multimedia; Section 3, Ensure that Images Do Not Slow Downloads”.

<li id="fn80"><p>“Limit the Use of Images: Use images only when they are critical to the success of a Web site. Ensure that a Web site’s graphics add value and increase the clarity of the information on the site. Certain graphics can make some Web sites much more interesting for users, and users may be willing to wait a few extra seconds for them to load. Users tend to be most frustrated if they wait several seconds for a graphic to download, and then find that the image does not add any value. Some decorative graphics are acceptable when they do not distract the user.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 14: Graphics, Images, and Multimedia; Section 9, Limit the Use of Images”.

<li id="fn82"><p>“Use terse, efficient markup.… Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style… While it is not intended that authors should create their content in a single line to remove white space altogether, it is suggested that authors should not contribute to page weight by introducing unnecessary white space. Note that ‘pretty printing’ (the formatting of markup with indentation) can generate large amounts of white space and hence add to page weight. If ‘pretty printing’ is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Even though some network proxies strip white space that they think is redundant, not all do so, so it is not best practice to rely upon this behavior. Use of structural markup… contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS.” –Rabin Jo, McCathie Nevile Charles (eds.), 2008. <em>Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines</em>.

<li id="fn83"><p>“Focus on Performance Before Preference: If user performance is important, make decisions about content, format, interaction, and navigation before deciding on colors and decorative graphics. Focus on achieving a high rate of user performance before dealing with aesthetics. Graphics issues tend to have little impact, if any, on users’ success rates or speed of performance.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 1: Design Process and Evaluation; Section 6, Focus on Performance Before Preference”.
