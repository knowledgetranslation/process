<p>These companion documents provide more in-depth information than is available here:</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We recommend that you read this document in its entirety before beginning a project, and refer to it often throught the project lifecycle. Although different sections of this document may apply to one type of reader more than the other (e.g. the <a href="#design-steps">Design Steps</a> are primarily targeted to designers), all readers can learn from all sections, and will benefit from having a holistic understanding of the process.</p>
<p>This process builds in lots of padding to budget, timelines, and scope. This creates failsafes to help mitigate the consequences of the unexpected barriers that lead projects to run over-budget, over-time, and under-scope.</p>
<h2 id="principles"><a href="#principles">2. Principles</a></h2>
<p>These principles should be examined and considered before the project starts, when the project ends, and at every step in between. At every step, every team member should consider how the principles apply to the step as a whole, and to their work in that step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li><p>Every stakeholder is a team member and every team member is a stakeholder.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exception: To avoid bias, usability tests should ideally be conducted and summarized by people completely separate from the rest of the team.</p>
<p>If the team members are the ones conducting usability tests, every effort should be made to avoid bias in testing.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><em>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)</em> states that a stakeholder is someone who “is actively involved in the project; has interests that may be positively or negatively affected by the performance or completion of the project; [or] may exert influence over the project, its deliverables or its team members”.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The <a href="http://www.pmi.org/">Project Management Institute</a>’s <a href="http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/">Voices on Project Management blog</a> suggests that different stakes to consider: interest, rights, ownership, knowledge, impact or influence, and contribution.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Involve all stakeholders at every step of the project, every meeting, and every decision point. Everybody should have the <em>opportunity</em> to participate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Involvement should be discussed and agreed upon at the first meeting. The team should make decisions about what the expectations are for every team member and what the timelines for response are.</p></li>
<li><p>For some parts of the project, a team member’s involvement will be mandatory, for others optional; but, every team member should have the option to participate in every stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Involvement does not simply equal presence. Every team member should have the option of <em>participating actively</em> and should be encouraged to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>E.g. designers should be involved during content creation, developers should be involved while creating timelines, users should be involved while planning scope<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Trust the expertise of your experts <em>in their area of expertise</em>. Being an expert in one area doesn’t make somebody an expert in another area.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. a content expert is not a designer; a developer is not a scientist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Don’t give disproportionate or inappropriate weight to trivial issues.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>e.g holding a meeting to discuss a typeface or the colour of a design element is probably not the best use of the team’s time. Instead, focus on content, functionality, and usability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Remember the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</a>, a founding web design principle encoded by the World Wide Web Consortium and Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (the organizations responsible for web standards):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity. In other words costs or difficulties to the user should be given more weight than costs to authors; which in turn should be given more weight than costs to implementors; which should be given more weight than costs to authors of the spec itself, which should be given more weight than those proposing changes for theoretical reasons alone. Of course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The original principle defines “authors” as web authors (i.e. web developers and designers who are building a site), “implementors” as browser implementors (i.e. software developers who build web browsers), and “specifiers” as those writing web standards specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>For our projects, we can alter these definitions while still retaining the spirit of the principle. “Specifiers” would be those team members who are responsible for planning, and “implementors” would be those responsible for content; the definitions for “users”, “authors”, and “theoretical purity” can remain unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>With these new definitions, we can resolve conflicts by giving more weight to costs/difficulties affecting users over developers/designers over content creators over planners over theoretical purity. But, as always, solutions should ideally improve things for multiple/all constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that this principle does not mean we should always defer to what each constituency wants or says they want; it means that in cases of conflict we should look at evidence and use that evidence to prioritize benefits to users over authors, etc.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> We always prioritize evidence over expert opinion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>No single user is more important than another user.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. mobile users need the same access to the same content as desktop users, disabled users need the same access to the same content as able users, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usability tests are for identifying problems, not for generating suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users might think they know how to solve these problems, but they may be wrong. They aren’t the experts in tool development, you are. <em>However</em>, they may be knowledge experts in the context of the tool usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Usability test summaries focus on identifying problems rather than solutions. While user-suggested solutions should be considered, final decisions on solutions should be decided by experts on your team.</p></li>
<li><p>“Users are most valuable in helping designers know what a system should do, but not in helping designers determine how best to have the system do it.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usability testing should only ever focus on one area at a time (e.g. either content, look-and-feel, or functionality). If you want to test multiple areas, conduct separate usability tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usability tests should have specific performance and success goals.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You’re building for the web, so use web-compatible technologies.</p>
<p>When you use a technology that’s not directly compatible with the web, the content you generate needs to be <em>adapted</em> or <em>translated</em> before it can be used. In some cases this can lead to loss of quality (e.g. with images being recompressed as they are converted), the introduction of errors (e.g. with text being transferred between programs or re-typed). In all cases it will introduce a financial and time cost, by creating more work for developers and designers who need to adapt this content.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create content using plain text, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, or HTML; not in Microsoft Word (and especially not PDFs or PowerPoint).</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, design <em>in the browser</em><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> using CSS, not in software designed for print, like Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign (and especially not in non-design software like PowerPoint, Word, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Define design in terms of web units (e.g. colours as hex values, sizes and distances in pixels and ems, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate using version control software and services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, not by emailing and turning on Track Changes in Microsoft Word.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Make sure all designs account for and define all interactions and states (clicks, hovers, transitions, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>A site should be completely usable without any special instruction to the user, and without any documentation.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>“A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.” —Martin LeBlanc<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>“No line of instruction will compensate for a bad design.” —Robert Hoekman Jr.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Build everything (content, design, development) modularly: you’ll probably be on another project where you can re-use components.</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g., Brad Frost’s <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design methodology</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If possible, provide translations, localization, and/or internationalization that is appropriate for your intended audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you’re building a site in English only <em>now</em>, build it so that translation, localization, and/or internationalization can be easily incorporated later.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if explicit translation doesn’t occur, sites should still be built so that they’re easy for users to translate on their own, using machine translation (e.g. <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>), and easy to understand if English is not their first language. (Note that these are accessibility requirements under <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#meaning">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Guideline 3.1</a>.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Avoid social components (e.g. forums, chat, blogs, social media) when possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social media sharing “widgets” have huge performance costs (i.e. they slow down your site)<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and there is little evidence to suggest that they increase sharing or traffic.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> They can also be used to track your users, creating potential security and privacy issues.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Forums, blogs, and chat often suffer because they don’t offer anything that users can’t get elsewhere. To be successful, these components “must have a specific purpose and deliver value members aren’t receiving elsewhere”.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In order to maintain reader intesest, these must also be updated frequently with high-quality content, which creates time and financial burdens and is difficult to maintain.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Even when properly maintained, users may not use or benefit from these features.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Avoid requiring users to log in with a username and password.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a password cannot be avoided, show it in plain text with an option to obscure it<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and provide an automated way for users to reset their own passwords.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keep sites up-to-date and relevant, and plan <em>how</em> you’ll do this on an ongoing basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Document everything you do at every step and use version control software for every piece.</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody should track their hours. Ideally hours should be tracked according to specific tasks. One good way to do this is to make every task a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> issue, and associate all hours with specific issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking the time it takes to create each feature can help with scoping and budgeting future projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Publish what you publish. Knowledge translation depends on dissemination; we need share what we’re creating.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make all website content public, not password protected or behind a paywall.</p></li>
<li><p>If it can’t be made public, then it probably shouldn’t be on the website. Use other services, like intranets, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Open source all the developed designs, code, documentation, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out what your rights are when you publish papers about the project. If possible make the papers available as widely as possible, for free, even if it costs extra money.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Research as much as possible. Learn as much as possible. Collect as much relevant data as possible. We should always strive to do evidence-based web development.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in the open. Avoid decision-making over email or in private conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All meetings should have a secretary, and that secretary should take notes <em>visibly</em> (e.g. on a whiteboard, so other attendees can contribute and update notes where they see fit). Ideally, meetings should also be audio recorded and made available to members who weren’t able to attend. Ideally, any sketches should be photographed/scanned and be included with the minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>All decision-making between meetings should be done in an open forum, such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Give credit where it’s due. In <a href="#steps">Steps 1–3</a> you’ll clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member. With all the documentation you develop, including git logs and timesheets, you’ll be able to verify who did what. Give appropriate credit to <em>everyone</em> in <em>all</em> the following places:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the website (e.g. in a humans.txt file, in page metadata)</li>
<li>in the website’s documentation (e.g. CONTRIBUTORS.MD on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li>in papers about the project (e.g. authorship for anybody that had decision-making responsibility, acknowledgements for every other team member)</li>
<li>in presentations (e.g. on an acknowledgements slide)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="steps"><a href="#steps">3. Steps</a></h2>
<p>When possible, all steps should be completed in sequence, not in parallel.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Determine who the stakeholders and team members are.</p></li>
<li><p>For each of the following areas, determine which team member is the most responsible person: planning, content, design, development, and science. The most responsible person should be an expert in their area.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most responsible person will have the final decision on matters related to their area(s).</p></li>
<li><p>All other team members are still welcome to provide <em>feedback</em> on all other areas.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For every team member that’s not a most responsible person, determine which area (planning, content, design, development, and science) they will focus on.</p>
<ul>
<li>All other team members are still welcome to provide <em>feedback</em> on all other areas, but they should have a specific focus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Determine the maximum budget that is available, and divide by two. This is your operating budget.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember: extra money is a good problem to have.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using your operating budget and timelines as guides, determine the ideal project scope<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, then reduce it by half. This is your scope for <em>this phase</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A focused project is more likely to be successful, and there will always be time for more phases later.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be best to think of each phase as a collection of specific features. (E.g. Phase 1 might be a collection of static content pages, Phase 2 might add videos or other interactive content, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to consider <em>all</em> the steps in this document when considering timelines, including multiple rounds of usability and testing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plan exactly what data you’d like collected for research, testing, and development/planning purposes, and define why you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collecting “too much” data, to the point where you’re overwhelmed by it, is a risk. However, not having data that you later realize you need is also a risk. If you think you <em>might</em> need it, it’s probably worth collecting.</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, try to collect as much data as possible <em>anonymously</em>. Identifiable data should be avoided whenever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re collecting data, write a privacy policy and submit it to the Research Ethics Board (REB) and/or Legal department, and make sure to include it in the publicly-available content you develop in the <a href="#content-steps">Content steps</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Research</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Study the data collected from other projects and earlier versions of this project, and interview stakeholders (especially users). Determine what content and features are important to whom and why, how they will be used, and where they will be accessed from.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Every team member should spend at least one full day reading about their area of focus (and especially about how it applies to the web), and another full day about an area on which they aren’t focusing and/or in which they aren’t an expert. This helps ensure that everybody’s knowledge is current and continues to grow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Based on your research, create user personas that reflect different types of typical and atypical users.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>usability.gov provides <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">a detailed method for creating user personas</a>, including best practices, questions to ask, elements to consider, examples, and references.</p></li>
<li><p>When creating user personas for accessibility testing, remember to consider a wide range of accessibility concerns. See, for example, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-July-31">An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that these form a useful but incomplete subset of your users; real users will never behave as you expect, nor should they.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#content-steps">Content steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#design-steps">Design steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the <a href="#development-steps">Development steps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a launch plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If this is an update to an existing site, develop a plan for how users will transition to the new version. Give them options to opt-in to the new version early and to opt-out for a set period after launch. Plan specific changeover dates and stick to them. Create and make available change documentation explaining what has changed and why.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Provide communication and feedback channels, and plan how these will be monitored.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan how data will be monitored during the launch/transition period, and how to react/make adjustments based on this data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a post-launch plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decide what actions will be required for maintaining and updating the site, who will be responsible for this, and where the funds will come from.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for how to monitor and react to usage and other data post-launch. For example, tracking usage of individual features can help determine if they should be removed, and can help with scoping and budgeting for future projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for who will monitor and respond to the communication channels that were defined in your launch plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implement your launch plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the final phase of your launch plan is complete, implement your post-launch plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are in the post-launch phase, have all the stakeholders go over the built-up documentation (minutes, git logs, documentation, style guides, READMEs, help files, timesheets, papers written, etc.) and compile a “bible” for the project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This should include take-aways that can be used in future projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute relevant pieces to any department documents (process docs, pattern libraries, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to document, in as much detail as possible, any failures or barriers, the approaches that were taken to resolve them, and whether or not these worked.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="content-steps"><a href="#content-steps">3.1 Content steps</a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Develop or choose an existing style guide for content, <em>before</em> you actually start creating any of the content. This style guide should be updated throughout the process (as indicated).<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Making already-created content conform to your style guide is much more work than developing content with a style guide already in-place.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of well-known existing style guides for content include <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/">The Chicago Manual of Style</a> and <a href="http://www.thecanadianpress.com/products_and_services.aspx?id=86">The Canadian Press Stylebook</a> (which St. Michael’s uses as the base for its internal style guide). These include information about how spelling, punctuation, capitalization, grammar, and formatting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Information Architecture (IA): create a plan for how your content will be structured, both at a high-level (e.g. site navigation) and a low-level (e.g. sections within documents/pages). Then, reduce the complexity of your IA by half.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Your users usually have very specific goals when visiting a web site. Don’t clutter their experience, and don’t give them what they don’t need.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conduct usability testing on the content. Can users understand it and get the info they need?<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to test with <em>real</em> users and/or users that closely match each of your personas.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Revise the content based on the usability test feedback.</p></li>

</ol>
<h3 id="design-steps"><a href="#design-steps">3.2 Design steps</a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create basic design templates that account for all the content and work well for all users, regardless of:</p>

<li><p>Browser (e.g. modern IE, obsolete IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Connection speed (e.g. high-speed/broadband, LTE, 3G, 2G, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ability (e.g. using a mouse, using a keyboard, without assistive technology, with a screenreader, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>Language (e.g. with machine-translation support)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, this fallback should work in the “Default Delivery Context”, which <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">The W3C Recommendation on Mobile Web Best Practices</a> defines as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Usable Screen Width: 120 pixels, minimum</p></li>
<li><p>Markup Language Support: XHTML Basic 1.1 delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml</p></li>
<li><p>Character Encoding: UTF-8</p></li>
<li><p>Image Format Support: JPEG, GIF89a</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum Total Page Weight: 20 kilobytes</p></li>
<li><p>Colors: 256 Colors, minimum</p></li>
<li><p>Style Sheet Support: CSS Level 1. In addition, CSS Level 2 <span class="citation">@media</span> rule together with the handheld and all media types.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP: HTTP/1.0 or more recent [HTTP1.1]</p></li>
<li><p>Script: No support for client side scripting</p></li>

<li><p>Perform the <a href="#design-validation-substeps">Design validation substeps</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Document in detail how each element of each template progressively enhances from the fallback design to the mobile design to the desktop design. Make sure there is complete content- and functionality-parity between all three designs, and that it’s clear how each element adjusts in changing circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>This process will probably require creating a few extra alternate design templates at different “breakpoints”, i.e. an adjustment when something breaks or looks bad at a certain size or when a certain feature is/isn’t supported. Always create these alternate templates based on breakpoints and not specific devices.</li>

<li><p>Develop HTML and CSS versions of each fallback template, using real content.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Note that the best ways to achieve high-ranking search results are to have high quality content; semantic, validated code; and high performance. All of these should have been handled before this point in the process.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>Given the variability in how users access the web, responsive design has become an industry standard; sites need to be responsive because we cannot account for how a user will be using a site. Not designing responsively risks excluding a large number of users. According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a>, in June 2014 mobile web usage is 26.64% (up from 15.31% in June 2013), tablet web usage is 6.4% (up from 4.65% in June 2013). Moreover, according to <a href="http://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/graph/?country=ca&amp;category=MOBI&amp;topic=Q09B&amp;stat=Q09B_1&amp;wave=2013&amp;age=all&amp;gender=all&amp;chart_type=&amp;active=stat">OurMobilePlanet</a>, 74% of Canadians access the web from their mobile devices daily. However, these discrete, broad categories can also obfuscate the fact that “mobile” and “tablet” aren’t really consistent; screen resolution varies wildly. <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> also tracks 14 separate screen resolutions that people use to access the web in signficant numbers, but the highest percentage of access for any one resolution is 20.13% (for 1366x768 pixels); far more users (27.84%) fall into the “other” category. We cannot design for individual devices, device types, or resolutions; we must instead allow our designs to <em>respond</em> to the users’ viewing context.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>“…One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts… Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations.” –Rabin Jo, McCathie Nevile Charles (eds.), 2008. <em>Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines</em>.

Furthermore, we are required by law (The <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_05a11_e.htm">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005</a>) to make all our websites accessible.

<li id="fn5"><p>Using progressive enhancement facilitates making responsive and accessible websites, and also helps us make websites that work with the wide variety of browsers in use. We see similar variety in browser versions as we do in screen resolution; <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> tracks 12 popular browser versions with significant usage, the highest being “Android 0” at 6.38%. The largest segment is, again, the “Other” category, with 48.1%. Progressive enhancement with feature detection allows us to accomodate this variability and offer good experiences to users no matter what their browser and version.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>

One of the basic principles of user-centered design is the early and continual focus on users. For this reason, user involvement has become a widely accepted principle in the development of usable systems. Involving users has the most value when trying to improve the completeness and accuracy of user requirements. It is also useful in helping to avoid unused or little-used system features. Users are most valuable in helping designers know what a system should do, but not in helping designers determine how best to have the system do it.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 1: Design Process and Evaluation; Section 4, Involve Users in Establishing User Requirements”.

<li id="fn8"><p>Using a usability tester without a vested interest in the project avoids injecting bias. From Rubin &amp; Chisnell, <em>Handbook of Usability Testing: How to Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests</em>, 2008, ‘Chapter 9. Conduct the Test Sessions’: “Take the attitude that you have no vested interest in the results one way or the other. Present the product neutrally (this does not mean you need to be solemn), so that the participants cannot ascertain any preference on your part. Never indicate through your speech or mannerisms that you strongly approve or disapprove of any actions or comments offered by a particular participant. React to ‘mistakes’ or ‘wrong turns’ in exactly the same way as you do to correct behavior. Never make participants feel stupid or inadequate (even inadvertently) by how you respond to their actions. If a participant is having problems, remember that it is the fault of the product. Period. Even if you say and do all the right things, participants will still blame themselves. If that happens, remind them of the value of their difficulties in understanding how the product actually works. Encourage them to freely explore areas without concern for ‘looking good.’”<a href="#fnref8">↩</a></p></li>

Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first.… The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic ‘front loaded’ style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area.… Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.

The iterative design process helps to substantially improve the usability of websites, improve task completion rates, and improve user satisfaction.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 18: Usability Testing; Section 1, Use an Iterative Design Approach”.

One study showed that users usually do not look at Web sites that are not in the ‘top 30’. Some of the features required to be in the ‘top 30’ include appropriate meta-content and page titles, the number of links to the Web site, as well as updated registration with the major search engines.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 1: Design Process and Evaluation; Section 8, Be Easily Found in the Top 30”.

<li id="fn74"><p>“Announce Changes to a Web Site: Announce major changes to a Web site on the homepage - do not surprise users. Introducing users to a redesigned Web site can require some preparation of expectations. Users may not know what to do when they are suddenly confronted with a new look or navigation structure. Therefore, you should communicate any planned changes to users ahead of time. Following completion of changes, tell users exactly what has changed and when the changes were made. Assure users that all previously available information will continue to be on the site. It may also be helpful to users if you inform them of site changes at other relevant places on the Web site. For example, if shipping policies have changed, a notification of such on the order page should be provided.” —U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. <em>The Research-Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, Enlarged/Expanded edition</em>. “Chapter 5: The Home Page; Section 8, Announce Changes to a Web Site”.

<li id="fn75"><p>“Carry out testing on actual devices as well as emulators. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site’s suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices. Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical.” –Rabin Jo, McCathie Nevile Charles (eds.), 2008. <em>Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines</em>.

Strive to maintain download speeds to less than five seconds. To improve download speeds, use several small images rather than a single large image. Repeat images when possible, and save images with the ‘interlaced’ or ‘progressive’ option. Limit page sizes to less than 30,000 bytes. Minimize the number of different colors used in an image, and add pixel dimension tags (e.g., height and width) to the image reference.

Certain graphics can make some Web sites much more interesting for users, and users may be willing to wait a few extra seconds for them to load. Users tend to be most frustrated if they wait several seconds for a graphic to download, and then find that the image does not add any value.

<li id="fn82"><p>“Use terse, efficient markup.… Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style… While it is not intended that authors should create their content in a single line to remove white space altogether, it is suggested that authors should not contribute to page weight by introducing unnecessary white space. Note that ‘pretty printing’ (the formatting of markup with indentation) can generate large amounts of white space and hence add to page weight. If ‘pretty printing’ is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Even though some network proxies strip white space that they think is redundant, not all do so, so it is not best practice to rely upon this behavior. Use of structural markup… contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS.” –Rabin Jo, McCathie Nevile Charles (eds.), 2008. <em>Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines</em>.
