# Web writing guidelines

Our websites, like all St. Michael's communications, adhere to Canadian Press Style as outlined in our Style Guide.  In addtion to our style guide, here are some useful resources and tips to keep in mind when writing for a website or other digital channels (screens, social media, etc.).

Reading on the web is a different experience than reading printed material. Keep in mind these habits of online readers:

1. Reading online is **25% harder** than print.
2. People **don't actually read** to find information. They read websites the way they read signs while driving along the highway, **scanning for key words and signs**.
3. People are **impatient** and **fickle**. They want to find something and they want to find it fast. It costs very little to leave your site to find what they're looking for elsewhere.
4. People are **skeptical**. Everyone's a publisher on the web, so anything can get published. People know that and will quickly leave your site if it doesn't give them what they need.
5. People **dislike the language of marketing**. It's not good enough to say we're the best at something: we have to show it with concrete examples.
6. People **want your opinion**. And having an opinion means doing some of the searching for your reader to save them the time and effort. It's about sorting through all the information and giving them only what's relevant.

The following rules can help achieve your goals and reach your audience effectively on the web:

* use plain language
* write text so it can be scanned quickly (short sections with clear subheadings)
* highlight keywords
* get to the point (Use inverted pyramid style – most important information first)
* keep it short (short sentences, short and simple paragraphs, one idea per paragraph)
* use sub-headings to facilitate scanning link to bulleted lists (Use subheadings as hyperlinks to lists)
* use lists to convey benefits, features or facts include white space between paragraphs
* Headlines should be bolded, not underlined. Use lower case as much as possible.
* avoid gender bias
* cut your word count by 50% of any print document.

## Text length guidelines

* Page Titles: one to five words
* Headings: four to eight words
* Lines: nine to 12 words
* Sentences: 15 to 20 words
* Paragraphs: 40 to 70 words
* Documents: 500 to 700 words

## Hyperlinks

* Text used for linking should be descriptive and tell the user what they are downloading or where they are going
* never underline words that are not part of a link
* try not to say ‘click here’ or ‘click on’ – in fact, try to avoid the word ‘click’ – instead, use ‘select’ or ‘choose’ or ‘read’
* warn your audience if you offer a link to a non-html page (such as a PDF or a Powerpoint presentation) and give them an idea of how big the document is and how long it will take to download

## Capitals

* refrain from using ALL CAPS as it is typically harder to read and is commonly used to indicate ‘shouting’ when on-line
