## Introduction

This style guide documents writing, editing, visual, and coding styles specific to the Knowledge Translation Program at St. Michael’s Hospital. The hospital also has its own style guides, and generally follows <i>The Canadian Press Stylebook</i>.

To determine the correct approach in a given circumstance, please consult style guides in the following order:

1. A project-specific style guide, if one is available
2. This document
3. The St. Michael’s guides. Always check the intranet for the most up-to-date versions. Guides include:
	* [St. Michael’s Style Guide](assets/smh-style-guide.pdf) [SMHSG]
	* [St. Michael’s Visual Standards](assets/smh-brand-standards.pdf) [SMHVS]
	* [St. Michael’s Colour Palette](assets/smh-colour-palette.pdf) [SMHCP]
	* [St. Michael’s Logo Guidelines](assets/smh-logo.pdf) [SMHLG]
	* [St. Michael’s Photography Guidelines](assets/smh-photography-guidelines) [SMHPG]
	* [St. Michael’s Web Writing Guidelines](assets/smh-web-writing-guidelines.md) [SMHWWG]

5. [<i>The Canadian Press Caps and Spelling</i>](http://www.thecanadianpress.com/products_and_services.aspx?id=86) [CPCS]
6. [<i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195418163.001.0001/acref-9780195418163) [COD]. When this gives alternative spellings, use the first one listed.

For some items, this guide repeats content from the above guides. In cases where a rule is sourced from another style guide, the rule will be marked with a code (listed in square brackets above) indicating its source. In such cases, it’s best practice to double-check the original source for more information.

## Spelling

## Terminology

### E

## Capitalization

### Capitalize

* University and college department names, e.g. “Faculty of Medicine” [SMHSG]
* Formal names of departments and programs within St. Michael’s [SMHSG]
* Honoric titles, e.g. “Dr.”

### Do not capitalize

* Corporate or organizational department names other than those listed above [SMHSG]
* Job titles or roles [SMHSG]
* Diseases, conditions, symptoms, tests, or treatments, unless they include proper names (e.g. “meales” versus “German measels”).

#### I

* **internet**, not “Internet”
* **intranet**, not “Intranet” [SMHSG]

## Abbreviations

* Ampersands (“&”) should only be used when part of a formal name (e.g. of an organization), or as part of a visual component, e.g. a wordmark.

### Do not abbreviate

* Days of the week [SMHSG]
* Months

## Punctuation

* Always use the Oxford comma (a.k.a. a “serial comma”).
* Placement of punctuation and quotation marks is complex!

	In general, punctuation should go outside the quotation marks…

	* She said she was going to a “store”.
	
	…unless it is part of the quoted text.

	* “I’m going to the store!” she shouted.
	* “Am I going to the store?” she asked.
	
	Within a sentence, a quoted period may be converted to a comma.
	
	* “I’m going to the store,” she said.

	Non-interrogative terminal punctuation (e.g. “.”, “!”) should not appear both in and outside the quotation marks; in this case, use the first mark (i.e. inside the quotation marks).

	* She said, “I’m going to the store.”
	
	A period within a quotation should be ommitted when immediately preceding a question mark.

	* Did she say, “I’m going to the store”?

	An exclamation mark within a quotation should not be ommitted when immediately preceding a question mark.

	* Did she shout, “I’m going to the store!”?

	A sentence-final period should be ommitted when immediately following a quoted question.

	* Did she ask, “am I going to the store?”

* For an exclamatory question, use an interrobang (“‽”) or “?!” 

## Dates and times

* Do not add “st”, “nd”, “rd”, or “th” to dates [SMHSG]
* Do not abbreviate days of the week or months (see Abbreviations)
* In prose, format dates as ‘Day D Month, Year’, e.g. “Wednesday 17 September, 1980”. If only using the month and year, the comma should be ommitted, e.g. “September 1980”.
* In non-prose situations, format dates as ‘YYYY-MM-DD’, e.g. “1980‒09‒17”. Note that this format uses figure dashes, not hyphens (see Punctuation).

## Measurements

* Use metric for all measurements, with conversions into other systems as an optional parenthetical, e.g. “100 metres (328 feet)”

## Names

* On first reference, use full name including honorifics. On second reference, use honorific title (but not suffixes) and last name. E.g. “Mary Smith” followed by “Dr. Smith”, “John Appleseed” followed by “Mr. Appleseed”.

## Numbers

* Write out all integers from zero to nineteen, use numerals for any other number, e.g. “fifteen”, “25”, “−15”
* For negatives, use a minus sign, not a hyphen, e.g. “−15” versus “-15”
* Use commas to separate numbers with four or more digits, e.g. “4,500” versus “4500” [SMHSG]

## Grammar

* “they”, “their”, and “them” should be used as non-gender-specific singular, third-person pronouns. Never use “he or she”, etc.
