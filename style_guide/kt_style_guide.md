## 1. Introduction

This style guide documents writing, editing, visual, and coding styles specific to the Knowledge Translation Program at St. Michael’s Hospital. The hospital also has its own style guides, and generally follows <i>The Canadian Press Stylebook</i>.

To determine the correct approach in a given circumstance, please consult style guides in the following order:

1. A project-specific style guide, if one is available

2. This document

3. The [AMA Manual of Style](http://www.amamanualofstyle.com/) (for citations/references only)

4. The St. Michael’s guides. Always check the [intranet](http://portal/) for the most up-to-date versions. Guides include:

	* [St. Michael’s Style Guide](assets/smh-style-guide.pdf) [SMHSG]

	* [St. Michael’s Visual Standards](assets/smh-brand-standards.pdf) [SMHVS]

	* [St. Michael’s Colour Palette](assets/smh-colour-palette.pdf) [SMHCP]

	* [St. Michael’s Logo Guidelines](assets/smh-logo.pdf) [SMHLG]

	* [St. Michael’s Photography Guidelines](assets/smh-photography-guidelines) [SMHPG]

	* [St. Michael’s Web Writing Guidelines](assets/smh-web-writing-guidelines.md) [SMHWWG]

5. [<i>The Canadian Press Stylebook</i>](http://www.thecanadianpress.com/products_and_services.aspx?id=86) [CPS]

6. [<i>The Canadian Press Caps and Spelling</i>](http://www.thecanadianpress.com/products_and_services.aspx?id=86) [CPCS]

7. [<i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195418163.001.0001/acref-9780195418163) [COD]. When this gives alternative spellings, use the first one listed.

For some items, this guide repeats content from the above guides. In cases where a rule is sourced from another style guide, the rule will be marked with a code (listed in square brackets above) indicating its source. In such cases, it’s best practice to double-check the original source for more and up-to-date information.



## 2. Writing


### 2.1 Abbreviations and acronyms

See also [Glossary, spellings, and abbreviations](../glossary/).

* Ampersands (“&”) should only be used when part of a formal name (e.g. of an organization), or as part of a visual component, e.g. a wordmark. [CPS] (See Punctuation)

* No period should be used in all-uppercase or mixed-case abbreviations (e.g. “MD”, “PhD”), including geographical abbreviations (e.g. “US” not “U.S.”).

	* Exception: titles/honorifics that preceed a name, e.g. “Mr.”

* Periods should be used in lower-case abbreviations (e.g. “e.g.”, “etc.”), even when sentence-initial (e.g. “e.g.” and “E.g.”).

	* Exception: metric measurements (e.g. “cm” not “c.m.”)

	* Exception: “p” for “probability” (but “p.” for “page”)

* “E.g.” and “i.e.” should not be followed by a comma.

* In prose, abbreviations should generally be defined before being used, e.g. “Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)” followed by “CIHR”.

	* Exception: common abbreviations that have have been lexicalized in English, e.g. “etc.” [CPS]

	* Exception: honorifics/degree names, e.g. “Mr.”, “PhD” [CPS]

	* Exception: common measurement terms (e.g. “cm”)

* If an abbreviation would only be used once, abandon it and spell the word/phrase out in full.

* “A” versus “an” before an abbreviation depends on its initial sound, not its initial letter, e.g. “an MA”, “a PhD”. [CPS]

* Other than the following (lexicalized) exceptions, never abbreviate “electronic x” as “e-x”, “ex”, or “eX”:

	* e-commerce

	* e-reader

	* ebook

	* email

* When abbreviating hyphenated names, omit the hyphen, e.g. “MP Gagnon”, not “M-P Gagnon”

* When abbreviating the names of US states and territories, use the United States Postal Service abbreviations

* Pluralized abbreviations use an “s” with no apostrophe, e.g. “UFOs” or “PhDs” [CPS]

#### 2.1.1 Do not abbreviate

* Days of the week [SMHSG]

* Months

* Non-metric measurement terms, e.g. “inches” not “in.”

* “electronic” (see above)

* Portions of addresses/street names, e.g. “King Street East” not “King St E”

	* Exception: “Saint” and “Sainte” may be abbreviated as “St.” and “Ste.” in place names. For Quebec place names, these are followed by a hyphen, not a period, e.g. “Ste-Agathe” [CPS]

* “county”, “fort”, “mount”, “point”, or “port” as part of a proper name, e.g. “Mount Everest” not “Mt Everest” (CPS)

### 2.2 Capitalization

See also [Glossary, spellings, and abbreviations](../glossary/).

* For French and other non-English titles, capitalize as in the original language (e.g. first word capitalized in French). [CPS]

#### 2.2.1 Capitalize

* Proper names; trade names; government departments and agencies; names of associations and companies, clubs, religions, languages, nations, races, places, and addresses [CPS]

* University and college department names, e.g. “Faculty of Medicine” [SMHSG]

* Formal names of departments and programs within St. Michael’s [SMHSG]

* Honoric titles, e.g. “Dr.” [CPS]

* Titles of books, journals, magazines, and other publications [CPS]

* The first word for scientific names of animals [CPS]

#### 2.2.2 Do not capitalize

* Corporate or organizational department names other than those listed above [SMHSG]

* Job titles or roles [SMHSG]

* Diseases, conditions, symptoms, tests, or treatments, unless they include proper names (e.g. “measels” versus “German measels”). [SMHSG]

* Headings

* Chapters, article titles, etc.

### 2.3 Citations and references

* In general, follow AMA citation style and [JAMA’s guidelines](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/public/instructionsForAuthors.aspx#References). In cases of disagreement, follow JAMA.

* In addition to AMA style, always include a URL to fulltext if available, or an abstract if not.

* If available, always include PMID, PMCID, doi, and other unique identifiers.

* In reference lists we always list all authors. Normally AMA only lists up to six authors; for more than six authors it lists three plus “et al.”, but we will not follow this guideline.

* For articles submitted but not yet accepted, list as “Submitted for publication” and do not list a journal name.

* For articles accepted but not yet published, list as “In press”.

### 2.4 Dates and times

* Do not add “st”, “nd”, “rd”, or “th” to dates [SMHSG]

* Do not abbreviate days of the week or months (see Abbreviations)

* In prose, format dates as ‘Day D Month, Year’, e.g. “Wednesday 17 September, 1980”. If only using the month and year, the comma should be ommitted, e.g. “September 1980”.

* In non-prose situations, format dates as ‘YYYY-MM-DD’, e.g. “1980‒09‒17”. Note that this format uses figure dashes, not hyphens (see Punctuation).

* Use BCE (before common era) and CE (common era) instead of BC (before Christ) and AD (anno Domini)

* Abbreviated years should include an apostrophe, e.g. “’81” for “1981” [CPS], but should be avoided if possible

* Decades should not include an apostrophe before the plural “s”, e.g. “the 1990s” or “the ’90s”, not “the 1990’s” [CPS]

### 2.5 Grammar

* “they”, “their”, and “them” should be used as non-gender-specific singular, third-person pronouns. Never use “he or she”, etc.

* it’s fine to end a sentence with a preposition [CPS]

* it’s fine to split infinitives [CPS]


### 2.6 Measurements

* Use metric for measurements [CPS]

* Conversions into other systems may be included as an optional parenthetical, e.g. “100 metres (328 feet)”, or possibly “100 metres (about 325 feet)”

* [Use proper primes for measurements](http://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/) such as feet, inches, longitude, and latitude.

* In prose, avoid abbreviating measurement units (see Abbreviations and acronyms) [CPS]

* For Celsius and Farenheit temperatures, use a degree sign, e.g. “15ºC” and “15ºF”

* Include a space between a measurement and the unit.

	* Exceptions: the space is ommitted before/after a degree symbol, primes, and currency symbols

### 2.7 Numbers

* Write out all integers from zero to nine, use numerals for any other number, e.g. “nine”, “25”, “−15” [CPS]

	* Exception: When an abbreviation/symbol for a unit is used, use a numeral, e.g. “$5” or “five dollars”, not “$five” or “5 dollars” [CPS]

* For negatives, use a minus sign, not a hyphen, e.g. “−15” versus “-15”

* Use commas to separate numbers with four or more digits, e.g. “4,500” versus “4500” [SMHSG]

* Use numerals for integers up to 999,999; after that, use words for multiples of one million or one billion. E.g. “900,000 birds” vs. “one million birds” or “1.2 million birds”

* Because of regional differences in meaning, avoid “billion” if possible

* Spaces should be used around all mathematical operators, e.g. “1 + 3 = 5”.

* Decimal numbers between 0 and 1 should always have a leading zero, e.g. “0.1”. [CPS]

* Use arabic numerals; avoid roman numerals except in proper nouns [CPS]


### 2.8 People, biographies, and names

* In prose, on first reference, use full name including honorifics. On second reference, use honorific title (but not suffixes) and last name. E.g. “Mary Smith” followed by “Dr. Smith”, “John Appleseed” followed by “Mr. Appleseed”.

* In prose, a preferred short-form of a first name is acceptable for the first reference, e.g. “Johnny Appleseed” followed by “Mr. Appleseed”.

* In general, omit middle names and initials (but defer to the subject’s personal preference [CPS])

* In headers (e.g. in biographies), use full name without short forms, middle initials, and honorifics.

* Biographies should be written in the third person.

* Treat individual biographies as a standalone chunk of content when making decisions about abbreviations.


### 2.9 Punctuation

* Ampersands (“&”) should only be used when part of a formal name (e.g. of an organization), or as part of a visual component, e.g. a wordmark. [CPS] (See Abbreviations and acronyms)

* Always use a single space after a period, question mark, comma, semi-colon, etc.

* Always use the Oxford comma (a.k.a. a “serial comma”).

* [Use proper (“curly” or “smart”) quotation marks for quotes and proper primes for measurements](http://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/). Only use straight quotation marks with code.

* Placement of punctuation and quotation marks is complex!

	In general, punctuation should go outside the quotation marks…

	* She said she was going to a “store”.

	…unless it is part of the quoted text.

	* “I’m going to the store!” she shouted.

	* “Am I going to the store?” she asked.

	Within a sentence, a quoted period may be converted to a comma.

	* “I’m going to the store,” she said.

	Non-interrogative terminal punctuation (e.g. “.”, “!”) should not appear both in and outside the quotation marks; in this case, use the first mark (i.e. inside the quotation marks).

	* She said, “I’m going to the store.”

	A period within a quotation should be ommitted when immediately preceding a question mark.

	* Did she say, “I’m going to the store”?

	An exclamation mark within a quotation should not be ommitted when immediately preceding a question mark.

	* Did she shout, “I’m going to the store!”?

	A sentence-final period should be ommitted when immediately following a quoted question.

	* Did she ask, “Am I going to the store?”

* For an exclamatory question, use an interrobang (“‽”) or “?!”, but generally try to avoid these sentences

* Avoid using a slash, with the following exceptions:

	* “either/or”

	* “and/or”

* When a slash is used, there are no spaces surrounding it.

* Use appropriate dashes rather than hyphens

	* An em dash to denote a break in a sentence

	* A quotation dash to set off the source of a quote

	* An en dash for a range of values

	* An en dash for attributive compounds

	* An en dash to show a relationship or connection

	* A figure dash for phone numbers and dates

	* A minus sign for subtraction or negative numbers

* In prose, use “to” instead of a dash (or hyphen) to indicate a range of values

* Do not use spaces around dashes or hyphens

* Use a proper ellipses character (“…”) rather than three periods (“...”)


### 2.10 Spelling

See also [Glossary, spellings, and abbreviations](../glossary/).

* When referencing companies, organizations, products, or other proper nouns, use their official spelling.

### 2.11 Terminology

See also [Glossary, spellings, and abbreviations](../glossary/).

* In general, refer to drugs by their generic names, notbrand names [CPS]

### 2.12 URLs

* URLs should always be linked, if links are supported

* Omit the protocol (e.g. “http://” or “http://”) for the web and email, but include explicitly or in prose for less common protocols (e.g. FTP, Skype, etc.) [CPCS]

* Omit “www” subdomains (e.g. “google.com”, not “www.google.com”), if possible



## 3. Design


### 3.1 Typography

* Fonts for abbreviations that contain no lower case letters should use small caps, or be 90% of normal size.



## 4. Media

### 4.1 Images

* Photographs should be saved in high-quality JPEG or TIFF format at 72dpi at least 1000 pixels long on the shortest side.
